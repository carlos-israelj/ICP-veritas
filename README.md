# üó≥Ô∏è Veritas: Decentralized Electoral News Verifier with AI on Internet Computer

## üèÜ AI Track - ICP Hackathon Project

**Veritas** is pioneering the future of decentralized AI applications on Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), building transparent and trustless electoral verification systems without middlemen. This project exemplifies how AI can be made decentralized, secure, and scalable on blockchain infrastructure.

## Project Overview

**Veritas** is a **Decentralized Electoral News Verifier** specialized for Ecuador 2025 elections and beyond. Its primary mission is to combat misinformation by enabling users to analyze the veracity of news texts through advanced AI technology. The project provides detailed analysis including concise summaries, confidence levels, consulted sources, verification reasoning, relevant context, information consistency, and reader recommendations.

A key feature of Veritas is its integration with **external AI engines (Perplexity AI)** for deep, contextualized analysis, while maintaining a **robust local fallback mechanism** ensuring basic verification functionality remains available even when external APIs are inaccessible.

## üåê Multilingual Intelligence

Veritas features **automatic language detection** and supports both **English and Spanish** analysis:
- üá∫üá∏ **English**: Full analysis for international electoral news
- üá™üá∏ **Spanish**: Specialized analysis for Latin American elections
- ü§ñ **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects input language and responds accordingly
- üîÑ **Seamless Experience**: No manual language switching required

## üèóÔ∏è Decentralized Architecture

This project is built on **Internet Computer (ICP)**, operating as a **Decentralized Application (dApp)** with clear separation between backend and frontend, embodying the principles of decentralized AI.

### 1. Backend (Canister `project_backend`)

The brain of the news verifier, implemented as a Motoko canister.

* **Technology:** Developed in **Motoko**, ICP's native programming language optimized for canisters.
* **Core Functionality:**
    * **Input Validation:** Manages validation of received news text (max 4000 characters, non-empty).
    * **Perplexity AI Integration:** Performs **HTTP Outcalls** to interact with external Perplexity AI API. Sends carefully structured prompts instructing the AI to act as a news verifier specialized in elections, requesting responses in predefined JSON format.
    * **Multilingual Processing:** Automatic language detection and language-specific prompt generation.
    * **Response Parsing:** Processes and parses JSON responses from Perplexity AI, extracting fields like `resultado`, `confianza`, `resumen`, `fuentes_consultadas`, `evidencia`, `contexto`, `consistencia`, and `recomendaciones`.
    * **Fallback Mechanism:** When Perplexity API calls fail, the canister executes `performLocalAnalysis` function that performs basic verification based on predefined keywords, ensuring preliminary results are always provided.
    * **State Persistence:** Motoko canisters offer default state persistence, maintaining the internal state of the `NewsFactChecker` actor securely on blockchain without external databases.
    * **Utility Functions:** Includes auxiliary functions for string handling (JSON escape/unescape) and type conversion.
    * **Public Functions (`Canister Methods`):**
        * `analyzeNews(newsText)`: Main function to initiate verification process.
        * `greet(name)`: Example function for basic interaction.
        * `getSystemInfo()`: Provides metadata about verifier version, supported languages, max text length, and API provider.
        * `testApiConnection()`: Allows verification of Perplexity API connectivity.

### 2. Frontend (Canister `project_frontend`)

Interactive user interface enabling users to interact with the system.

* **Technology:** Developed as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using **React** for dynamic UI construction, **Vite** as fast bundler for development and production optimization, and **TypeScript** for robust, scalable development. Styles managed with **SCSS**.
* **Purpose:** Offers intuitive user experience where users can input news text and receive visually appealing, detailed analysis. Interface displays verification status, confidence level, summary, evidence, context, consistency, recommendations, and reference source links.
* **Backend Communication:** Communicates with `project_backend` on ICP using `@dfinity/agent` and `@dfinity/candid` libraries. The `declarations` folder contains Candid interfaces automatically generated by DFX, facilitating this interaction.
* **Deployment:** Web application is compiled and deployed as an *assets canister* on ICP network, meaning the frontend is hosted directly on blockchain, inheriting decentralization and censorship resistance.

### 3. Key Tools and Configurations

* **DFX (`dfx.json`):** Official Internet Computer SDK command-line tool. Manages canister lifecycle (creation, deployment, function calls) and automates Candid interface generation.
* **NPM (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`):** Used for Node.js dependency management in root project and `project_frontend` subproject.
* **Vite (`vite.config.js`):** Vite configuration, optimizing development process and final frontend compilation.
